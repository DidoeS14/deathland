### [The red ones]
A bright floating ball  appears out from a pure white room. This bright ball is Kavadar. He does not know what is happening yet. The only thing he knows is that he must continue 
further out of the while room. Kavadar goes through short tutorial of the basic movements. Kavadar meets his first enemy and learns how to hit them with a basic attack. Kavadar keeps
killing some enemies on his way further. While that he is introduced to verdure 1) potions (that he will be finding from time to time throughout the game).Eventually he faces an enemy
that is holding some unique red sword. Kavadar kills him and receives the sword. He receives as well a body. He discovers that with that body he is way stronger. Kavadar continues to 
go deeper in this what looks like a dungeon, solving puzzels, going through obsticles and dealing with enemies. After some time he reaches an old stone sign that says:
"If life is what you seek you shall fear not keep. Deep ahead life awaits behind Deathland's heavy gates "
Kavadar: -Deathland? Life? Hmm... I wonder what this riddle means...
	Later Kavadar meets the Knight Of Red. The ruler of everything red.
Redéye: - Who dares to disturb my peace? 
Kavadar: -... I am... I am aah... *remembers that he don't know his own name* ...*tries to think of something* ... My name is Kav... Kad... Kavadar! Yes! My name is Kavadar <br/>
	- And who do you think you are Kavadar? Holding so nonchalantly my sword?<br/>
	- I don't know. I... I just found it on the way here. I don't even...<br/>
	- And who killed all of my guardians ?<br/>
	- I.. but they...
	- So you are the one who killed so many of my people ah? Ok, this is the final end of you!<br/>
	- The final... end? What do you mean?<br/><br/>
A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Knight of Red [K] or to spare her [S]

[K]	Kavadar:	- You and your people will no longer threaten the travelers passing through here!<br/>
	Redéye:		- You will pay for this! Remember my word! You will pay!<br/>

|Nothing happens|

[S]	Kavadar:	- Here is your sword. Just let me be, ok ?<br/>
	Redéye:		- *catches her breath* Keep it. You weld it good.<br/>
			- Thank you then. I didn't catch your name.<br/>
			- It's Redéye... Tell me Kavadar. Why are you really here? You are not a standart dodger.	2) <br/>
			- I don't really know. I don't even know where I am coming from.<br/>
			- Ah, you are one of them. One of the consecrated ones. I should kill you right here and now. But since you spared my life I will spare your as well. 3) <br/>
			- Wait I don't understand really what do you mean?<br/>
			- You will find out soon enough. I wish you best of luck! You will need it, Kavadar! - Goes away.<br/>
|Mana regen goes faster|

### [The green ones]
	Kavadar continues down the dungeon, soon enough he finds a green object and notces that if he touches it he gets hurt.
In the next part Kavadar meats mostly pizzels, traps and obsticles that include the hurtful green and his red to show to the player the basic color mechanic
Eventually he starts seeing green enemies and he notices that they seem easier to hurt with his red sword. Soon after Kavadar meets Lord Moss.
	Radi'lus:	-Aaah. A red being dares crossing my biome? You must be the most brave or the most stupid of all.<br/>
	Kavadar:	- Is it... forbidden to cross through here?<br/>
			- Ofcourse it is you fool! Now prepare to be destroyed!<br/>
			- Oh, here we go again.<br/><br/>
A fight starts, Kavadar either chooses to kill the Lord Moss [K] or to spare him [S]

[K]	Radi'lus:	-Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	-You are the one who dies now! *kills him* *absorbs the green*<br/>
|Nothing happens|

[S]	Radi'lus:	- Now I see why you are so powerful. You are a consecrated dodger! You must die! Die! Here and now, die!<br/>
	Kavadar: 	- Yeah? And what is this thing consecrated dogder? Why everyone hates this thing?<br/>
- Oh no, no ,no,no. You are chosen! Chosen by the Necrosis to go back to the prevous realm! We should stop you!<br/>
- What? Wait, what is the Necrosis, what prevous realm?<br/>
			- You really don't know ah?<br/>
			- Obviously.<br/>
			- Well I will not tell you.<br/>
			- Eh, ok then. Bye! *goes away*<br/>
			- Wait, where do you think you are going?<br/>
			- I don't know. Wherever this path lead me.<br/>
			- Eh... eeh.. Wait! I want to give you something for not ending my life. Take this power. *gives the power of green* it should be helpful on your way down.<br/>
			- Oah! Thank you... eh...<br/>
			- Radi'lus.<br/>
			- Radi'lus!, yes thank you. My name is Kavadar by the way.<br/>
 			- Remember one thing, Kavadar. We are not friends, I give you this gift so you can get corrupt... ah... I mean... from pure kindness. The next time I see you I will kill you.<br/>
			- Then I will be ready to throw your stones on your own head. Goodbye Radi'lus! *goes away*<br/>

### [The blue ones]
Kavadar notices that the dungeon is going more and more deeper down. Eventualy he finds an old sign that says:<br/> "We came from Terrene, but Necrosis gave birth to us. Together with thy zingiberene we signed a truce. For the cause of defeating thy gods. So we won, omitting the odds"<br/>
Kavadar: -Hm... I am very intrigued. I should find more information about the past of this place. Better open my eyes for such signs.<br/>




# GAME LORE
************

### [Characters]
	Kavadar: A person that died in the realm of the living, aka Earth and came in the world of the dead without having any idea who he is, where he is and what happened. His goal
is to find out what is happening as well to decide what he should do in this realm.

	The Color Beings: The Color Beings were created by The Long Forgotten Gods. Each color corresponds to a different area of existing. Each unconsecrated dodger would become a color being
and specificly the type of being that corresponds of their failed purpose in the previous realm - Terrene. For example, if a dodger failed to become a great warrior in their past life, they would become
a red being so they can become wariors in this realm more easy. This way they would serve to The Long Forgotten Gods as a punishment for not improving anyhow the previous realm. The Color Beings
rose up eventualy and overthrowed The Long Forgotten Gods, locking them in the deepest corner of Deathland as a revenge, so they can never rule them again. The main leaders of the rebelion separated
the realm equaly. Since then they all made a promise to never let a dodger reach the gates to the previous realm, so the realm of Terrene can blunder and The Long Forgotten Gods's dream of improving it, gets 
destroyed. After time The Color Beings became greedy and started a war for teritory between each other. Sadly the war stays till nowadats as well as the promise.

	The Long Forgotten Gods: They are the gods that created the realm Deathland for the mortals, as well as many other realms. They were the most powerful creatures in the universe
but long time ago were overthrown by the people of Deathland. They were trapped somewhere deep in Deathland and were never heard of again. This happened so long time ago, that everybody forgot
their names and just refered to them as The Long Forgotten Gods.
	
	Knight Of Red: Her name is Redéye. She is a villian who rules the Red. Her father was the one who helped in the rebelion against The Long Forgotten Gods and calimed the title as ruler of the Red.
After his final death Redéye came on the throne as the new ruler. She is powerfull looking with pretty agressive fighting style, mainly with longsword and with shield. Even though her fighting style is fast
and agressive it remains pretty predictable. She can use magic as well and summon fireballs.

	Lord Moss: His name is Radi'lus. He is a villian who rules the Green. He and his brothers were part of the rebelion against The Long Forgotten Gods. After they defeated them they separated the
green biome between each other. In time the brothers grew hungry for more power and started the Green War, which ended with Radi'lus killing all of his brothers and keeping all the green biome for himself.
His prefered weapons are mace, moss magic and toxic waste. Using his moss powers he can move fast for short periods of time. Generaly his attacks are slow and heavy with lack of precision. Yet his
furious confidence and agression are visible.


### [Locations]
	Deathland: This is the main location in the game. Deathland was once created by The long forgotten gods, which made this place as a final realm for the
mortals, so the unsuccessfull ones can spend their eternaty serving the gods. While the succsessfull ones
could go back to the previous realm and live and improve the realm further. Sadly after time the citizens of
Deathland took over the realm as revenge against The long forgotten gods. They became guardians of thy
world and sweared with their final lives to prevent anyone of reaching the previous realm ever again.

	Necrosis: This the world between Terrene and Deathland. It is all white and it's used to decide the fate of all dodgers who will continue to Deathland.
